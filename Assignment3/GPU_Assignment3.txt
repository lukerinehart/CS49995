Assignment 3

1)  
       A) The local memory is “local” to each individual thread that called it, so with 1000 thread blocks and 512 threads per block, there would be 1000x512 = 512,000 different versions of the variable.
       
       B) The Shared memory is shared inside each thread block, so there would be 1000 different versions of the variable.

2) 
	A) In an NxN matrix multiplication with no tiling, each element is accessed N times

	B) With tiling would reduce access to global memory by a factor of T, so global memory is accessed N/T times.
