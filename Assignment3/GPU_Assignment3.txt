Assignment 3

1)  
       A) The local memory is “local” to each individual thread that called it, so with 1000 thread blocks and 512 threads per block, there would be 1000x512 = 512,000 different versions of the variable.
       
       B) The Shared memory is shared inside each thread block, so there would be 1000 different versions of the variable.

2) 
	A) In an NxN matrix multiplication with no tiling, each element is accessed N times

	B) With tiling would reduce access to global memory by a factor of T, so global memory is accessed N/T times.


	

3)
	The different memory usages, global memory, shared with interleaving addressing, and shared with sequential addressing will have different results.
	When dealing with an array of around 1000 values, the Interleaving Addressing did the worst with around 0.645, The Sequential Addressing did better with around 0.244,
	and Global Access with sequential addressing did the best with and a 0.120
