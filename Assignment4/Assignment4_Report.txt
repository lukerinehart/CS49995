Naive Implementation
	L = 12,  K = 5, Performance = 0.398784 ms
	L = 12,  K = 10 Performance = 0.388096 ms
	L = 100, k = 5, Performance = 0.577152 ms

Constant Memory Implementation
	L = 12,  K = 5, Performance = 0.331776 ms
	L = 12,  K = 10 Performance = 0.337476 ms
	L = 100, k = 5, Performance = 0.663328 ms


Shared Memory & Constant Memory Implementation
	L = 12,  K = 5, Performance = 0.328064 ms
	L = 12,  k = 10 Performance = 0.330124 ms
	L = 100, K = 5, Performance = 0.520928 ms
	L = 100, k = 10 Performance = 0.550382 ms


The most significant factor seems to be the lenght of the input L. Increasing K while keeping L the same caused performance to slightly drop
in both versions that used the constant memory for the mask, while the Naive implementation speed up slightly. The constant memory without shared
memory did the worst while L was high, while constant memory with shared memory did the best.
