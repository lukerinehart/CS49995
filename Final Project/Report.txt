This version of the Reaction Diffusion simulation has many issues and is not very viually pleasing, but can show the way that the
reactions between chemical A and B cause how a chemical can propagate.

The reactions are measured and calculated by 2d convolution by using nearby cells as input, and along with the convolution, a FEED factor
and KILL factor are also applied to calculate the value of the chemicals per cell. Each thread in the NxM matrix will have to gather
TxT values from its surrounding cells, and then use that information to calculate the new value of it's chemicals based on the applied
algorithm.

Ghost cells can be used to optimize the convolution. Implementing a Shared memory or Global Memory variation of Reaction Diffusion could
be difficult as there is no mask.

I have enjoyed learning the concepts to the Reaction Diffusion/Gray Scott simulation, but due to unforseen events, poor time management,
and many distractions, I was not able to put in much effort as I had wanted for this simulation.
